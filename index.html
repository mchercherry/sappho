      <h2>SAPPHO OF LESBOS</h2>
      <p>We begin with the origin of the word Sapphic and one of the most recognizable figures in history: Sappho. A woman who has left ripples throughout queer history, her name remains a cornerstone of our discussions. As she predicted, she is remembered.<br><br>Unfortunately, the memories of her are not always reliable. Much of the information that circulates now is based on accounts written centuries after her death. She is, according to Plato, the Tenth Muse, "The Poetess" to Homer's "The Poet," one of the nice great lyricists, and ultimately unforgettable. <br><br>Throughout the years, theory after theory has been brought up and subsequently shot down. Though many people will claim she was heterosexual, she is a recognized part of queer culture. Perhaps it is because of her obvious queerness or because the community itself has refused to let her fade into heterosexual obscurity—likely a healthy mixture of both. <br><br>Nevertheless, not all scholars or fellow artists were parties to the grand deception. Many risked their reputations and positions to defend the truth about Sappho. Queer or otherwise, historians and writers have not been a united front of homophobic erasure. If that were the case, there would likely be nothing left of her memory. <br><br>Her poetry is the only certain part of her we have.</p>

      <h2>DEBUNKING COMMON SAPPHO MYTHS</h2>
      <div class="container1">
        
        <div class="box1">
          <h4>X SAPPHO HAD A HUSBAND</h4>
          <p>Sappho's husband, Kerkylas, was a character introduced by the Suda, written centuries after her death. This was not the first time her life story had included a husband or even a male lover. The writers of such stories mistakenly assumed any man in her romantic or sexual life would mean she did not sleep with women. Moreover, though a man would not negate her queerness, her supposed husband's name translated to "Penis, from Men's Island." His existence is unlikely.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box2">
          <h4>X EROTIC DESCRIPTIONS' VOCATIONAL EXPLANATION</h4>
          <p>Scholars explained away her erotic descriptions of goddesses by placing her in the role of the priestess. In the Victorian Era, some tried to style her as the headmistress of a girls' school. There is little to no evidence for either position.<br>Willis Barnstone writes of these theories:<br>"It is no less than astonishing how otherwise temperate scholars became outraged and imaginatively unobjective at the slightest suggestions by others of moral frivolity on Sappho's part."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box3">
          <h4>X POEMS AREN'T ABOUT HER</h4>
          <p>After years of wild theories, homophobic historians have settled on a new take: her poetry was not, in fact, autobiographical. If such a claim was valid, then we truly know nothing of the real Sappho. <br>Many scholars seem content to accept that the poems are autobiographical when discussing other things, like politics or a feud with friends. However, as soon as it comes to her sexuality, they balk. Almost everything we know of her is speculation, at best rumors and gossip, the only exception being her work.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="box4">
          <h4>X SAPPHO IS NOT A WOMAN</h4>
          <p>This claim is much more recent and has a significantly lower following, especially by historians, but it is notable that some people say that Sappho was a man to explain her descriptions of women. However, most historians accept at least some of her poetry as autobiographical, and they point to her being a woman; not to mention the many other great writers throughout history who refer to Sappho as a woman in their praise of her work. There is not a shred of concrete evidence pointing to Sappho being a man.</p>
